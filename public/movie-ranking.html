<h1>The Best Series According to Khomotso</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all-time.</h2>

<h2>How To Get Away With Murder.</h2>
<p>This drama series is centered around law and crime. As a person that's always been fascinated with law, I absolutely enjoy when shows take a realistic approach to real life like scenarios and Viola Davis absolutely killed her performance.</p>
<h2>Insecure.</h2>
<p>I personally consider Issa Rae a genius for this one. The fact that at least everyone who has watched this show somewhat relates to it speaks volumes. It's so good that I have made it a norm to rewatch it every year just to kind of get perspective, if that makes sense.</p>
<h2>Sex Education</h2>
<p>I consider this one a coming of age show that I think every single teen should watch. It is a very educational show, with quite a good storyline. It's everything you would want in a show, a bit of romance, some comedy and a lot of insight.</p>
